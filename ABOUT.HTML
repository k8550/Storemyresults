                        <p><h3>This is the most obvious advantage of  exam result management . 
                        Generally, the traditional paper-based result management system takes time as the teachers need to collate the results, manually calculate, input it into the system and wait until 
                        the reports are printed.
                        This system can take up weeks – during which times the students have forgotten the context and the content of the exam questions. 
                        However, with an online system, the test results are calculated automatically and then results are ready to view or email within minutes.
                       </h3> </p><BR>

                       <h2><bold>2.ERROR FREE RESULTS</bold></h2><BR>
                       <P><h3> Many teachers, the examination period also is a time of stress and anxiety. 
                       This is because of the tiresome process of manually collecting the results, marking them, converting the marks into grades, and keeping them safe until the day the parents (or students) get to see them. 
                       One of the biggest downsides of the traditional form of result management, it that this entire system is prone to human errors and miscalculations.
                       While handling the manual exam papers, there is also a high chance of losing them, or damaging them due to unforeseen environmental situations. 
                       However, the online result management system eliminates all these problems. 
                       The automatic calculation and storage of the exam results reduces the burden on the educators and saves the results from any human errors or damages.

                        <P><h3>The immediate results not only help to reduce the stress of the students waiting for their results.
                        When they do receive their marks and scores, the faster results also help the students to realize their errors, work on relearning their concepts, and seek improvement before their next text.
                        The online system is able to generate an analytical report of the student’s performance.
                        This report can give the teachers and the parents an accurate understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the child, their academic interests, and the topics on which they might need additional tutoring.</h3></P>

                                                 Most often, these biases can creep in unknowingly, but they affect the marks and the morale of the student. 
                                                On the other hand, the online result management system is free from any such biases towards any student. 
                                                Student report generator is a web based application designed and engineering colleges that need to manage results across multiple branches students that need to track, manage and report results. 
                                                This application can run on any kind of operating system. 
                                                At a time we can see all the years result in a single sheet and we can see the individual candidate’s results separately.
